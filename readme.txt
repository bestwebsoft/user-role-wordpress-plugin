We can fix some things for free for the users who provide translation of our plugin into their native language (this should be a new translation of a certain plugin, you can check available translations on the official plugin page).

== Installation ==

1. Deactivate the plugin if you have the previous version installed.
2. Extract "user-role.zip" archive content to the "/wp-content/plugins/user-role" directory.
3. Activate "user-role" plugin via 'Plugins' menu in WordPress admin menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What default settings will be restored if I click on the Recover capabilities button? =

When the User Role plugin is activated it creates a backup of current roles and capabilities for your main blog and it will be restored if you click on the Recover capabilities button.

= When I delete the User Role plugin will the settings of privileges be changed back? =

No. They will stay changed unless you click on the Recover capabilities button.

= How can I use the other language files with User Role? =

Here is an example for Russian language files.

1. In order to use another language for WordPress it is necessary to set a WordPress version to the required language and in the configuration wp file - `wp-config.php` in the line `define('WPLANG', '');` you should enter `define('WPLANG', 'ru_RU');`. If everything is done properly the admin panel will be in Russian.

2. Make sure the files `ru_RU.po` and `ru_RU.mo` are present in the plugin (the folder "Languages" in the plugin root).

3. If there are no such files you should copy the other files from this folder (for example, for German or Italian) and rename them (you should write `ru_RU` instead of `de_DE` in both files).

4. The files can be edited with the help of the program Poedit - http://www.poedit.net/download.php - please download this program, install it, open the file using this program (the required language file) and for each line in English you should write translation in Russian.

5. If everything is done properly all lines will be in Russian in the admin panel and in the front-end.
